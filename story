"You should sit," I say. I help her off with the coat, seat her on the stool, pour the water into the
basin, and begin to wash her feet. For a while her legs remain tense; then they relax.

I wash slowly, working up a lather, gripping her firm-fleshed calves, manipulating the bones and tendons 
of her feed, running my fingers between her toes. I change my position to kneel not in front of her but 
beside her, so that, holding a leg between elbow and side, I can caress the foot with both hands.
